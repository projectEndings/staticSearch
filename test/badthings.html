            <h1>File with bad things in it</h1>
            <p data-ss-img="images/elephant.png">This file has a number of bad, ignominious features, including the fact that it has no title, no id,
            and no useful information whatsoever. It  tells you nothing of any value and is generally 
            not worth reading. It also elephant has the word elephant three elephant times.</p>
            
            
            <p>We also include the word artichoke here, although it should be ignored by the indexer
            because it is in the stopwords list for this test set.</p>
            
            <p>Other features important for testing are the use of linebreaks to separate
            words without any spaces, as here: cats<br/>dogs<br/>birds.</p>
            
            <p>Another thing we need to test is the handling of short words. The word bf
            is not in the stopword list so it should be indexed.</p>
            
            <p>One type of out-stretched: out-stretcht</p>
            <p>Another type of out-stretched: out-ſtretcht</p>
          
          <p>Now let's try some stuff that ought to be carefully sanitized 
            during indexing. This word should not appear in bold in the results: &lt;b&gt;bold&lt;/b&gt;. 
            Ditto here: \u003Cb\u003E bold \u003C/b\u003E. Here we have some already-escaped ampersands &amp; &amp; &amp;amp; bold &amp;amp; &amp; stuff.</p>
