It also creates JSON files for other search facets that you specify in the headers of your documents, to allow searches for documents by type, by date range, and so on. Then it creates a search page for your site, which processes user search terms and retrieves the required JSON files to provide search results.</p></div><div xml:id="textSearchFeatures"><head>Text search features</head><p>The Generator supports the following features:</p><list><item>Porter 2 stemming of terms (so searching for <q>wait</q> will also retrieve <q>waiting</q>, <q>waits</q>, <q>waited</q> etc.). Our stemmer is for English, but if you have documents in another language, you can create and plug in your own stemmer.</item><item>Boolean search operators. Adding <code>+</code> (plus) before a word means that search results <emph>must contain</emph> that word, and adding a <code>-</code> (minus) means that results <emph>must not contain</emph> that word. Words without plus or minus are treated as <emph>may contain</emph>, contributing to the score of any retrieved document.</item><item>Phrasal searches. Any quoted phrase will be searched as-is, and when quoted phrases are included in a search, any hit document must contain at least one of them. Note that phrasal search support requires a specific setting in your configuration file, because it increases the size of the index.</item><item>Keyword-in-context search results. This is also configurable, since including contexts increases the size of the index.</item><item>Search filtering using any metadata you like, allowing users to limit their search to specific document types.</item></list></div><div xml:id="searchFacetFeatures"><head>Search facet features</head><p>The Generator supports the following search facets:</p><list><item><term>Descriptors</term>. You might for example classify your documents as poems, short stories and novels; the user can then choose to search in only poems, or poems and short stories.</item><item><term>Date ranges</term>. You might assign each document a date (or a date range) for its first publication and another for its last publication; then users could search for documents first published in a certain date range and last published before another date.</item><item><term>Booleans</term> (true/false values). You might for instance specify that some poems are illustrated while others are not. The user could then limit their search only to illustrated poems.</item></list></div><div xml:id="howDoIUseIt"><head>How do I use it?</head><p>First, you will have to make sure your site pages are correctly configured so that the Generator can parse them. Then, you will have to create a configuration file specifying what options you want to use. Then you run the generator, and the search functionality should be added to your site.</p><div><head>Configuring your site: search filters</head><p>The generator is expecting to parse <emph>well-formed XHTML5 web pages</emph>. That means web pages which are well-formed XML, using the XHTML namespace. If your site is just raggedy tag-soup, then you can't use this tool.</p><p>Next, you will need to decide whether you want search filters or not. If you want to allow your users to search (for example) only in poems, or only in articles, or only in blog posts, or any combination of these document types, you will need to add <gi>meta</gi> tags to the heads of your documents to specify what these filters are. Here is a simple example: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><meta name="Document type" class="staticSearch.desc" content="Poems"/></egXML> This specifies that there is to be a descriptive search filter called <q>Document type</q>, and one of the types is <q>Poems</q>; the document containing this <gi>meta</gi> tag is one of the Poems. Another type might be: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><meta name="Document type" class="staticSearch.desc" content="Short stories"/></egXML> If the Generator finds such meta tags when it is indexing, it will create a set of filter controls on the search page, enabling the user to constrain the search to a specific set of filter settings.</p><p>Another slightly different kind of search control is a document date. If your collection of documents has items from different dates, you can add a <gi>meta</gi> tag like this: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><meta name="Date of publication" class="staticSearch.date" content="1895-01-05"/></egXML> The date may take any of the following forms: <list><item>1895 (year only)</item><item>1895-01 (year and month)</item><item>1895-01-05 (year, month and day)</item></list> For some documents, it may not be possible to specify a single date in this form, so you can specify a range instead, using a slash to separate the start and end dates of the range (following ISO 8601): <list><item>1895/1897</item><item>1903-01-02/1905-05-31</item></list></p><p>A third filter type is the boolean (true/false) filter. To use boolean filters, add meta tags like this to your documents: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><meta name="Peer-reviewed" class="staticSearch.bool" content="true"/></egXML></p></div><div xml:id="configuringDocTitles"><head>Configuring your site: document titles</head><p>When the indexing process runs over your document collection, by default it will use the document title that it finds in the <gi>title</gi> element in the document header; that title will then be shown as a link to the document when it comes up in search results. However, that may not be the ideal title for this purpose; for example, all of your documents may include the site title as the first part of their document title, but it would be pointless to include this in the search result links. Therefore you can override the document title value by providing another meta tag, like this: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><meta name="docTitle" class="staticSearch.docTitle" content="What I did in my holidays"/></egXML></p></div><div xml:id="creatingConfigFile"><head>Creating a configuration file</head><p>The configuration file is an XML document which tells the Generator where to find your site, and what search features you would like to include. The configuration file conforms to a schema which is documented here.</p><p>There are three main sections of the configuration file: <list><item><ref target="#TEI.params">&lt;params&gt;</ref></item><item><ref target="#TEI.rules">&lt;rules&gt;</ref></item><item><ref target="#TEI.contexts">&lt;contexts&gt;</ref></item></list> Only the <ref target="#TEI.params">&lt;params&gt;</ref> element is necessary, but, as we discuss shortly, we highly suggest taking advantage of the <ref target="#TEI.rules">&lt;rules&gt;</ref> and <ref target="#TEI.contexts">&lt;contexts&gt;</ref> for the best results.</p><div><head>Specifying Parameters (Required)</head><p>The <ref target="#TEI.params">&lt;params&gt;</ref> element has two required elements for determining the resource collection that you wish to index: <list><item><ref target="#TEI.searchFile">&lt;searchFile&gt;</ref></item><item><ref target="#TEI.recurse">&lt;recurse&gt;</ref></item></list></p><p>The <ref target="#TEI.searchFile">&lt;searchFile&gt;</ref> element is a relative URI (resolved, like all URIs specified in the config file, against the configuration file location) that points directly to the search page that will be the primary access point for the search. Since the search file must be at the root of the directory that you wish to index (i.e. the directory that contains all of the XHTML you want the search to index), the searchFile parameter provides the necessary information for knowing what documents to index and where to put the output JSON.</p><p>Note that all output files will be in a directory that is a sibling to the search page. For instance, in a document collection that looks something like: <list style="font-family: monospace"><item>myProject <list><item>novel.html</item><item>poem.html</item><item>shortstory.html</item><item>search.html</item></list></item></list> The collection of Javascript and JSON files will be in a directory like so: <list style="font-family: monospace"><item>myProject <list><item>novel.html</item><item>poem.html</item><item>shortstory.html</item><item>search.html</item><item><emph>staticSearch</emph></item></list></item></list></p><p>We also require the <ref target="#TEI.recurse">&lt;recurse&gt;</ref> element in the case where the document collection may be nested (as is common with static sites generated from Jekyll or Wordpress). The <ref target="#TEI.recurse">&lt;recurse&gt;</ref> element is a boolean (true or false) that determines whether or not to recurse into the subdirectories of the collection and index those files.</p></div><div><head>Specifying Rules (Optional)</head><p>The <ref target="#TEI.rules">&lt;rules&gt;</ref> elements specifies a list of conditions (using the <ref target="#TEI.rule">&lt;rule&gt;</ref> element) that tell the parser, using XPath statements in the <hi rend="att">xpath</hi> attribute, specific weights to assign to particular parts of each document. For instance, if you wanted all heading elements (<gi>h1</gi>, <gi>h2</gi>, etc) in documents to be given a greater weight and thus receive a higher score in the results, you can do so using a rule like so: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><rules><rule weight="2" xpath="h1 | h2 | h3 | h4 | h5 | h6"/></rules></egXML> Since we're using XPath 3.0 and XSLT 3.0, this can also be simplified to: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><rules><rule weight="2" xpath="*[matches(local-name(),'^h\d+$')]"/></rules></egXML> (It is worth noting, however, the above example is unnecessary: all heading elements are given a weight of 2 by default, which is the only preconfigured weight in static search.)</p><p>The value of the <hi rend="att">xpath</hi> attribute is transformed in a XSLT template match attribute, and thus must follow the same rules (i.e. no complex rules like <code>p/ancestor::div</code>). See the <ref target="https://www.w3.org/TR/xslt-30/#dt-pattern">W3C XSLT Specification</ref> for further details on allowable pattern rules.</p><p>Often, there will be elements that you want the tokenizer to ignore completely; for instance, if you have the same header in every document, then there's no reason to index its contents on every page. These elements can be ignored simply by using a <ref target="#TEI.rule">&lt;rule&gt;</ref> and setting its weight to 0. For instance, if you want to remove the header and the footer from the search indexing process, you could write something like: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><rule weight="0" xpath="footer | header"/></egXML> Or if you want to remove XHTML anchor tags (<gi>a</gi>) whose text is identical to the URL specified in its <hi rend="att">href</hi>, you could do something like: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><rule weight="0" xpath="a[@href=./text()]"/></egXML></p><p>Note that the indexer does not tokenize any content in the <gi>head</gi> of the document (but as noted above, metadata can be configured into filters) and that all elements in the <gi>body</gi> of a document are considered tokenizable. However, common elements that you might want to exclude include: <list><item><gi>script</gi></item><item><gi>style</gi></item><item><gi>code</gi></item></list></p></div><div><head>Specifying Contexts (Optional)</head><p>When the static search creates the keywords-in-contexts (the "kwic" or "snippets") for each token, it does so by looking for the nearest block-level element that it can use as its context. Take, for instance, this unordered list: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><ul><li>Keyword-in-context search results. This is also configurable, since including contexts
                    increases the size of the index.</li><li>Search filtering using any metadata you like, allowing users to limit their search to specific
                    document types.</li></ul></egXML> Each <gi>li</gi> elements is, by default, a <term>context</term> element, meaning that the snippet generated for each token will not extend beyond the <gi>li</gi> element boundaries; in this case, if the <gi>li</gi> was not a context attribute, the term <q>search</q> would produce a context that looks something like: <eg>"...the size of the index.<hi style="font-weight:bold;">Search</hi> filtering using any metadata you like,..."</eg></p><p>Using the <ref target="#TEI.contexts">&lt;contexts&gt;</ref> element, you can control what elements operate as contexts. For instance, say a page contained a marginal note, encoded as a <gi>span</gi> in your document beside its point of attachment:<note place="foot">This example taken from Thomas S. Kuhn, <title level="m">The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</title> (50th anniversary edition), University of Chicago Press, 2012: p. 191.</note> <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><p>About that program I shall have nothing to say here,<span class="sidenote">Some information on this subject can be found in "Second Thoughts"</span> [...]
                </p></egXML> Using CSS, the footnote might be alongside the text of the document in margin, or made into a clickable object using Javascript. However, since the tokenizer is unaware of any server-side processing, it understands the <gi>span</gi> as an inline element and assumes the <gi>p</gi> constitutes the context of the element. A search for <q>information</q> might then return: <eg>"...nothing to say here,Some <hi style="font-weight:bold;">information</hi> on this subject can be found...</eg> To tell the tokenizer that the <gi>span</gi> constitutes the context block for any of its token, use the <ref target="#TEI.context">&lt;context&gt;</ref> element with an <hi rend="att">xpath</hi> pattern: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><contexts><context xpath="span[contains-token(@class,'sidenote')]"/></contexts></egXML></p><p>You can also configure it the other way: if a <gi>div</gi>, which is by default a context block, should not be understood as a context block, then you can tell the parser to not consider it as such using <hi rend="att">context</hi> set to false: <egXML xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/Examples"><contexts><context xpath="div" context="false"/></contexts></egXML></p><p>The default contexts elements are: <list><item><gi>body</gi></item><item><gi>div</gi></item><item><gi>blockquote</gi></item><item><gi>p</gi></item><item><gi>li</gi></item><item><gi>section</gi></item><item><gi>article</gi></item><item><gi>nav</gi></item><item><gi>h1</gi></item><item><gi>h2</gi></item><item><gi>h3</gi></item><item><gi>h4</gi></item><item><gi>h5</gi></item><item><gi>h6</gi></item><item><gi>td</gi></item></list></p></div></div></div><div xml:id="howDoesItWork"><head>How does it work?</head><div xml:id="buildingTheIndex"><head>Building the index</head><p>The tokenizing process first processes your configuration file to create an XSLT file with all your settings embedded in it. Next, it processes your document collection using those settings. Each document is tokenized, and then a separate JSON file is created for each distinct token found; this file contains links to each of the documents which contain that token, as well as keyword-in-context strings for the actual tokens. There will most likely be thousands of these files, but most of them are quite small. These constitute the textual index.</p><p>In addition, separate JSON files are created for the list of document titles, and for your stopword list if you have specified one.</p><p>Next, if you have specified search facets in your document headers, the processor will then create a separate JSON file for each of those search facets, consisting of a list of the document identifiers for all documents which match the filters; so if some of your documents are specified as <soCalled>Illustrated</soCalled> and some not (true or false), a JSON file will be created for the <soCalled>Illustrated</soCalled> facet, with a list of documents which are true for this facet, and a list of documents which are false.</p><p>Finally, the template file you have created for the search page on your site will be processed to add the required search controls and JavaScript to make the search work.</p></div><div xml:id="theSearchPage"><head>The search page</head><p>In order to provide fast, responsive search results, the search page must download only the information it needs for each specific search. Obviously, if it were to download the entire collection of thousands of token files, the process would take forever. So when you search for the word <mentioned>waiting</mentioned>, what happens is that the JavaScript stems that word, producing <mentioned>wait</mentioned>, then it downloads only the single file containing indexing information for that specific word, which is very rapid.</p><p>However, there is some information that is required for all or many searches. To display any results, the list of document titles must be downloaded, for example. A user may for instance use the search facets only, not searching for a particular word or phrase but just wanting a list of all the documents classified as <soCalled>Poems</soCalled>. This requires that the JSON file with information about that facet be downloaded. So there is some advantage in having the JavaScript start downloading some of the essential files (titles, stopwords and so on) as soon as the page loads, and it also starts downloading the facet files in the background.</p><p>At the same time, though, we don't want to clog up the connection downloading these files when the user may do a simple text search which doesn't depend on them, so these files are retrieved using a <soCalled>trickle</soCalled> approach, one at a time. Then if a search is initiated, all the files required for that specific search can be downloaded as fast as possible overriding the trickle sequence for files that are needed immediately.</p><p>Once the user has been on the search page for any length of time, all ancillary files will have been retrieved (assuming they weren't already cached by the browser), so the only files required for any search are those for the actual text search terms; the response should therefore be even faster for later searches than for early ones.</p></div></div></body><back><div><div><head>Elements</head><div type="refdoc" xml:id="TEI.config"><head>&lt;config&gt;</head><index indexName="ODDS"><term sortKey="config">&lt;config&gt;</term></index><table rend="wovenodd"><row><cell cols="2" rend="wovenodd-col2"><hi rend="label">&lt;config&gt; </hi>(<seg>The root element for the Search Generator configuration file.</seg>) </cell></row><row><cell rend="wovenodd-col1"><hi rend="label" xml:lang="en">Namespace</hi></cell><cell rend="wovenodd-col2">http://hcmc.uvic.ca/ns/staticSearch</cell></row><row><cell rend="wovenodd-col1"><hi rend="label" xml:lang="en">Module</hi></cell><cell rend="wovenodd-col2">ss</cell></row><row><cell rend="wovenodd-col1"><hi rend="label" xml:lang="en">Contained by</hi></cell><cell rend="wovenodd-col2"><ab rend="parent">—</ab></cell></row><row><cell rend="wovenodd-col1"><hi rend="label" xml:lang="en">May contain</hi></cell><cell rend="wovenodd-col2"><ab rend="specChildren"><ab rend="specChild"><seg rend="specChildModule">ss: </seg><seg rend="specChildElements"><ref target="#TEI.contexts" rend="link_odd_elementSpec">contexts</ref><c xml:space="preserve"> </c><ref target="#TEI.params" rend="link_odd_elementSpec">params</ref><c xml:space="preserve"> </c><ref target="#TEI.rules" rend="link_odd_elementSpec">rules</ref></seg></ab></ab></cell></row><row><cell rend="wovenodd-col1"><hi rend="label" xml:lang="en">Content model</hi></cell><cell rend="wovenodd-col2"><eg xml:space="preserve">
